"vQmod"(TM) (aka Virtual Quick Mod) is a new innovation in php modification override methods.
Instead of modifying actual files to add custom modifications, source files are parsed
"on-the-fly" before the php include() or require() is called.
The source is cloned to a temp file and modifications are made to that temp file, then
substituted for the real file in the include path.

NOTE:
======
Please ensure you download from the RELEASES link above, or here - https://github.com/vqmod/vqmod/releases
The official source code splits out platforms and will not run correctly if you don't use a proper release zip from the above link
